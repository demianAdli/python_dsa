This is the title of a great book by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia and 
Michael H. Goldwasser. The book begins with a gentle but comprehensive introduction on Python. It 
continues to discuss object oriented programming with the language. The beauty of the book is where it 
explains about Algorithm Analysis as a prologue to the Data Structures.              
**However**, defined classes sometimes include errors. In at least one class (Range from chapter 2)
it is a hidden error and just affects the output when the step is negative. I have tried to fix
these errors. I also tried to make the classes easy to use, for those who's just begun to code.
Moreover, the book's classes have not been developed Pythonic in most of the cases. For example
it hardly uses the property decorater and defines data members mostly protected which is not
a good Python practice. In many cases, there are nested classes defined which is another bad 
Python practice. Sometimes I followed their approach, especial is first chapters. But I tried 
to correct the behavior of such classes wherever I could and plan to complete this goal.
Nonetheless, mentioned problems do not affect the great educational intentions of this book.
